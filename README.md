CanvasCameraPlugin
============================

This plugin has been updated to support the newest cordova version (~4.0).
It is intended to be used in the iOS version of LastClock (https://lastclock.net)
So some changes might not be for universal usages.

For best performance, the camera is initialized with Low quality at 6 fps.
A new hasNewFrame() function has been added to the js interface which could be used to check if new frame is available.
